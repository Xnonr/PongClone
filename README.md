# PongClone

A simple clone program of the original 1972 Atari game Pong written and coded in Python 3.7.4 with Jupyter Notebook.

Currently makes use of the 'turtle', 'random' and 'os' Python modules.

Can be played single player, with 2 people or let the computer face itself.

Also has a secondary 'Advanced' mode where the paddles may also move left and right.
